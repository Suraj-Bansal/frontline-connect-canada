           <hr>
           <p class = "donate-text2">Firstly, we are looking for devices that are in <span class="bold">good working order</span>. Our requirements are in place to ensure that each device is capable of running the communications apps that we will be loading, such as Zoom, Skype, and Google Duo. Most devices that are in good condition and less than 4 years old will be eligible for donation.</p>
           <p class = "donate-text2">Donated phones must be unlocked. Most devices bought after December 1st, 2017 should be unlocked already, but there are tutorials online that can confirm the process. We have linked the following tutorial for your perusal.</p>

           <h2 class="donate-faq">Why can't Frontline Connect Accept Devices that are Locked into Certain Carriers? What if I'm Interested in Donating, but my Phone is Locked?</h2>  
           <hr>
           <p class = "donate-text2">We have partnered with some phone companies who are providing us with SIM cards for our donated devices. These SIM cards can only be used by phones that are not locked to another carrier.</p>
           <p class="donate-text2">If your device is locked to your carrier, you may call your carrier and request they unlock it. Per the <a href = "http://crtc.gc.ca/eng/phone/mobile/codesimpl.htm" target = "_blank" class = "donate-link">Canadian Wireless Code</a>, section F.1.ii, your service provider <span class="bold">must</span> unlock your device for free upon your request.</p>

           <p class = "donate-text2">We are currently only accepting devices that are in good working order. These devices are going to healthcare providers and very sick, or elderly patients, and thus damage such as a broken volume button or a cracked screen could significantly impair their ability to use their communications apps.</p>

Facilities will be within a 30 minute drive at most – if there are none within a 30 minute drive, we will give you the option to donate to a further location, or you may hold onto your device in case another neighbourhood facility requests devices.</p>
